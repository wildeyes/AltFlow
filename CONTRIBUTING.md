# Helping out

Thank you for considering to help out with Altflow!

Any help with design (logo, app itself) would be appreciated. For coding help;

## Development Instructions

To install and develop the app locally;

- `git clone https://github.com/wildeyes/AltFlow`
- `cd altflow`
- `yarn` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or `npm start`

## What to work on.

There's a roadmap in README.md. If you'd like to implement something on your own go ahead and do so but preferably talk with me before.
